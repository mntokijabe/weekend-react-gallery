# React Favorites Photo Gallery


## Description

Duration: Weekend Sprint

This app provides an opportunity to post photos of favorite things, including a text description and a url must be provided. Currently actual photos must be put into the /public/images folder, but website photos just need a url. The form is at the bottom of the page.

Photos are initially displayed but if a photo is clicked the display toggles to the written description of the photo - and toggles back if the description is clicked.

Once displayed, there is a Like button. If it is clicked, it allows the user to unlike. A tally of Likes is displayed. Additionally, there is a Delete button to remove the posted photo.
